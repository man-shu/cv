Towards that regard, apart from carrying out the acquisitions, I have been developing a lot of task-based fMRI experiments spanning across several different target cognitive domains (\href{https://github.com/hbp-brain-charting/public_protocols}{GitHub repo}). In addition, I have also been working on preprocessing all kinds of brain MRI data including structural, functional, quantitative as well as diffusion MRI (\href{https://github.com/hbp-brain-charting/public_analysis_code}{GitHub repo}).}}
